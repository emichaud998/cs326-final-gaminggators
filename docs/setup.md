# Milestone 2: Setup

As of right now, there are no required steps needed to build our project. It is simply deployed on heroku at https://gamer-port.herokuapp.com/ and can be accessed there. As of right now, we have hard coded the heroku url for fetch requests and a static user id has been set as a global variable for every page. If you want to run this project locally, you will need to replace every heroku url (https://gamer-port.herokuapp.com) in the code with 'http://localhost:8080'. You then can run 'npm start' to start running the server on port 8080. If you want to change to change the user, you must check the list of random users generated by faker using either curl or postman to make a POST request to the endpoint /users/allUsers. This will return a list of users of which you can select one of the randomly generated user ids, and then change the static user ID global variables in the project to that value.
